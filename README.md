<h2>AutomateTheBoringStuff</h2>
<p>This is a repository whose purpose is merely as a testing bench for python code.</p>
<p>Most of the code is from the book "Automate the Boring Stuff" from Al Sweigart, note that I do not own any right over this code or ideas.</p>

<h4><b><a name="tictactoe.py" href="tictactoe.py">TicTacToe game</a></b></h4>
<p>This code is to test the efficiency of dictionaries, I ignore if there is a more practical way to do this (I mean the code to determine who wins the game)</p>
<h4><b><a href="pw.py" name="pw.py">Project: Password Locker</a></b></h4>
<p><b>Note:</b> In order to the batch file to work some changes may be needed, note that the route in the file is relative to where the python file is.</p>
<p>With this code I intended to test the use of python scripts as commands from the CMD of Windows.</p>
